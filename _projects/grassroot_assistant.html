<p>Imagine, you already have a Telegram group (or want to create) and you need to share it with people not far from you which you might not even know.

Another case: you are interested in groups within a geolocation radius (telegram private groups which are announced by someone). This Bot can help you with it.
</p>

<h4>How It Works</h4>

First, type `/start` in Bot and share your location. This location helps to search groups for you or to announce your own group.

If you want to search groups nearby, you can type `/list {radius}` and optionally define search radius as a parameter.

If the search is successfull, you can request to join the group: `/join {group}`. Group admins will be notified about your join request. 

Maybe, you want to link your group to a location and announce it to the World. Please, use command with parameters: `/link {group_name} {group_description}`.

<h4>Additionally</h4>

The group has outdated and you want to hide it from others? You can do it using `/delete_link {group}`.
