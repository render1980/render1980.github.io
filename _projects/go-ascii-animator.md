### What is it

The tool inspired by <a href="https://github.com/thatcherclough/AsciiAnimator">AsciiAnimator</a> but written in Golang just for fun ;)

Animate your ASCII graphics in your terminal.

### How It Works

1. Create a file with frames to animate.
2. Run the tool in your terminal with a path to the file as an argument
3. Enjoy!
